### Project Overview

 This project is based on how to visualize the data, analyze the data and show the data into the graph format.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project I have learned how to visualize the data and present in graph format.
I learned how to present bar chart, line chart, also to show scatter plot and histrograms.
**Histogram** takes in a series of data and divides the data into a number of bins. We should use histogram when we need the count of the variable in a plot.
**Bar chart** shows the distribution of data over several groups. It is used when to compare between several groups.
**Scatter plot** helps in identifying the relationship of the data with each variable i.e correlation or trend patterns. It is used in Machine learning concepts like regression, where x and y are continuous variables.
